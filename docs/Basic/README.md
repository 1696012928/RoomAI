##  Detailed Guidance

Before read detailed guidance, please read [quick guidance](https://github.com/roomai/RoomAI#1-quick-guidance)

There are some basic concepts in RoomAI: Player, Env, Info and Action. The basic procedure of a competition is shown as follows. All AI-bot player receive information from env, the current player takes a action, and the env forwards with this action.

<pre>
def compete(env, players):
   '''
   :param env: the game environments
   :param players: the array of players
   :return: the final scores of this competition
   '''
   infos, public_state, person_states, private_state = env.init()
   for i in xrange(len(players)):
       players[i].receive_info(infos[i])

   while public_state.is_terminal == False:
        turn = public_state.turn
        action = players[turn].take_action()
        
        infos, public_state, person_states, private_state = env.forward(action)
        for i in xrange(len(players)):
            players[i].receive_info(infos[i])

   return public.scores                
</pre>

![the basic procedure of roomai](https://github.com/roomai/RoomAI/blob/master/docs/game.png)

We define these basic concepts as abstract classes in [roomai/abstract/Abstract.py](https://github.com/roomai/RoomAI/blob/master/roomai/abstract/Abstract.py), and all corresponding classes must extend them.  


#### 1. Info

The info is the information sent by env to player, which is consisted of private_state„ÄÅ public_state and person_state. 

<pre>

class AbstractPrivateState:
    pass
    
class AbstractPublicState:
    turn            = None
    previous_id     = None
    previous_action = None

    is_terminal     = False
    scores          = None

class AbstractPersonState:
    id                = None 
    # if avilable_actions is non-None, it is a dict with (action_key, action) 
    available_actions = None 

class AbstractInfo:
    public_state       = None
    person_state       = None
</pre>


All infos contain the same public state. 

All infos contain the person state, and the person state is different for different players. Only the person_state in the info w.r.t the player who will take a action, contains non-None available_actions dict. 

The private_state won't be in any info, hence no player can access it.
#### 2. Action

A player takes a action, and env forwards with this action.

<pre>
class AbstractAction:
    def __init__(self,key):
        raise NotImplementedError("The __init__ function hasn't been implemented"
    def get_key(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("The get_key function hasn't been implemented")
</pre>

The get_key function generate the action's key.

#### 3. Player

A player is an AI-bot.

<pre>
class AbstractPlayer:
    def receive_info(self,info):
        raise NotImplementedError("The receiveInfo function hasn't been implemented") 

    def take_action(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("The takeAction function hasn't been implemented") 

    def reset(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("The reset function hasn't been implemented")
</pre>


#### 4. Env

The env is a environment of a game.
<pre>
class AbstractEnv:

    def init(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("The init function hasn't been implemented")

    def forward(self, action):
        raise NotImplementedError("The receiveAction hasn't been implemented")

    @classmethod
    def round(cls, env, players):
        raise NotImplementedError("The round function hasn't been implemented")
</pre>

The round function holds a competition for the players, and computes the scores.

#### 5. List of different games' info structure and action structure 

The info and action are  important concepts for AI-bot developers, and are very different for different games. We list info and action structures for the games supported by roomai:

##### [KuhnPoker]()
##### [Texas]()
