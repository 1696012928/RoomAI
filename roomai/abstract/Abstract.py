'''
The info is the information sent by env to player, which is 
consisted of private_state„ÄÅ public_state and person_state.

Three properties of info

1.1 If there are n players, env.forward will return n+1 infos. 
The i-th info is w.r.t the i-th player except the last info. 
The last info is designed for recording private_state, and 
only the last info contains non-None private_state. Hence, no 
player will get private_state

1.2 All infos contain the public_state.

1.3 All infos contain the person_state. For different players,
the person state is different. Only the person_state in the 
info w.r.t the player who will take a action, contains non-None
available_actions dict. non-None available_actions dict is with (action_key, action)
