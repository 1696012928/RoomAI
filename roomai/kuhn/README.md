Kuhn poker is an extremely simplified form of poker developed by Harold W.
Kuhn as a simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-information game, amenable to a complete game-theoretic analysis.
In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only three playing cards, for example a King, Queen, and Jack.
One card is dealt to each player, which may place bets similarly to a standard poker.
If both players bet or both players pass, the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins.
